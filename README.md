A little model representing the lifetime earnings of different types degree holders. People with only a highschool degree make a total of half a million dollars in their lifetime. While the average college graduate makes a total of 1.19M in their lifetime. Computer science majors ;however, make about 40 percent more than the average college graduate in their lifetimes.
